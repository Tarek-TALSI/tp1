# **Labs Pokemon C++**

During this TP I had the chance to discover and practice C++ programming, a language I didn’t know before.
I coded a very simple version of Pokemon. Sadly, I didn’t have time to add a graphic interface with SFML, so everything runs in the terminal.

The game is easy to understand:

- At the beginning, you meet random Pokemons that you can capture.
- When your team is full (6 Pokemons), the game gives you the choice between fighting a Pokemon or fighting a trainer.
- This continues until you lose, and then you go back to the main screen.

Even if it is simple, I think what I learned here will be useful for the PLT.
